# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to help Omar by creating visualizations of rideshare data to help improve ride-sharing services and determine the affordability for lower income neighborhoods. The rideshare data is supposed to show the different data among different city types, like the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and the total fare by city type. I was told to use matplotlib, instead of Excel so I used matplotlib for this visualization. Using matplotlib would impress the CEO, V. Isualize more by making a graph and tables as our data visualizations, which making this would help Omar analyze this data too.

## Results:

Among the different city types shown in the table above, the ridesharing data differs by the amount of drivers each city type has, the cost of using the rideshare services per ride, and amount of people needing rides depending on city type.

**Total rides:**

The total rides in rural cities were 125, total rides in suburban cities was 625, and the total rides in urban cities was 1,625. Rural cities had the least amount of rides, while urban cities made the most amount of rides.

**Total drivers:**

The total drivers in rural cities were 78, total drivers in suburban cities was 490, and the total drivers in urban cities was 2,405. Rural cities had the least amount of drivers, while urban cities had the most amount of drivers.

**Total fares:**

The total fares earned in rural cities were $4,327.93, total fares earned in suburban cities was $19,356.33, and the total fares earned in urban cities was $39,854.38. Rural cities earned the least amount of fares, while urban cities made the most.

**Average fare per ride and driver:**

The average fare per ride in rural cities was $34.62, while the average fare per driver in rural cities was $55.49. The average fare per ride in suburban cities was $30.97, while the average fare per driver was in suburban cities was $39.50. The average fare per ride in urban cities was $24.53, while the average fare per driver was $16.57. According to this data, the average fare per ride and driver in rural cities was the most. 

**Total fare by city type:**

The overall total fares by city type shows that urban cities made the most, while rural cities made the least. The reasoning behind this could be because per ride in rural cities was the most expensive per ride and priced at $34.62, which made it less appealing. The total fares by month depending on city type had its highs and low points, but the fares earned stayed similar to the ones of other city types too according “Total Fare by City Type” graph. For the total fares by city type, all the cities it’s lowest fare earned time in the month of January, while they all earned a good amount of fares near the end of February. 

## Summary:

From looking at the data tables, there are a few recommendations I would make. The first recommendation would be for the CEO to decrease the average fare for rural cities so that more riders can afford it. The average fare per ride in the rural cities is over thirty-four dollars, while the cities with a lower average fare have a lot more rides. If more riders could afford these rideshare trips, then that would make it more appealing to them and increase the money earned. Another recommendation I would make is to encourage the CEO to hire more drivers for the rural cities. The  rural cities only have 18 drivers, while the urban cities have 1625 drivers so that could be why urban cities are able to make more money. If they had more drivers, then the amount of people needing a ride could increase in rural cities. The third recommendation I would make is to charge more fares based on how many drivers they have at a given time. For example, the month of January seems to have the lowest fares earned. January has a big holiday at the beginning of the month that many people celebrate and would need a ride for, but the fares earned that month was still low compared to other months. This would cause there to be less drivers available, so during these times with big holidays, the company should charge more for a ride to earn more for the company since the data shows that not as much rides were given.
